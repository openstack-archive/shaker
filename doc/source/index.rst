Welcome to Shaker!
==================

**The distributed data-plane testing tool built for OpenStack.**

Shaker wraps around popular system network testing tools like
`iperf <https://iperf.fr/>`_, `iperf3 <https://iperf.fr/>`_
and netperf (with help of `flent <https://flent.org/>`_).
Shaker is able to deploy OpenStack instances and networks in different
topologies. Shaker scenario specifies the deployment and list of tests
to execute. Additionally tests may be tuned dynamically in command-line.
