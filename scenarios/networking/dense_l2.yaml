description:
  This scenario launches several pairs of VMs on the same compute node.
  VM are plugged into the same private network. Useful for testing performance
  degradation when the number of VMs grows.

deployment:
  template: l2.hot
  vm_accommodation: [pair, double_room, density: 8, compute_nodes: 1]

execution:
  size: 'linear_progression'
