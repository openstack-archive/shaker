description:
  This scenario launches 1 pair of VMs in different networks connected to one
  router (L3 east-west). VMs are hosted on different compute nodes

deployment:
  template: l3_east_west.hot
  accommodation: [pair, single_room, compute_nodes: 2]

execution:
  tests:
  -
    title: Iperf TCP
    class: iperf_graph
    sla:
    - "[type == 'agent'] >> (stats.bandwidth.min > 1000)"
    - "[type == 'agent'] >> (stats.bandwidth.mean > 2000)"
