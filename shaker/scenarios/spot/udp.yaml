title: UDP bandwidth

description: >
  This scenario uses iperf3 to measure UDP throughput between local host and
  ping.online.net (or against hosts provided via CLI). SLA check is verified
  and requires at least 10 000 packets per second.
  The destination host can be overridden by command-line parameter,
  e.g. ``--matrix "{host: 172.10.1.2}"``.
