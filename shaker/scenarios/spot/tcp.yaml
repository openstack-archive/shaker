title: TCP bandwidth

description: >
  This scenario uses iperf3 to measure TCP bandwidth between local host and
  ping.online.net (or against hosts provided via CLI). SLA check is verified
  and expects the speed to be at least 90Mbit and at most 20 retransmitts.
  The destination host can be overriden by command-line parameter,
  e.g. `--matrix "{host: 172.10.1.2}"`
