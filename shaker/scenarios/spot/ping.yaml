title: Ping

description: >
  This scenario uses ping to measure the latency between the local host and
  the remote. The remote host can be provided via command-line, it defaults
  to 8.8.8.8. The scenario verifies SLA and expects the latency to be at most
  30ms.
  The destination host can be overridden by command-line parameter,
  e.g. ``--matrix "{host: 172.10.1.2}"``.
