title: OpenStack L2 Performance

description:
  In this scenario Shaker launches 1 pair of instances in the same tenant
  network. Each instance is hosted on a separate compute node. The traffic goes
  within the tenant network (L2 domain). Neutron QoS feature is used to limit 
  traffic throughput to 10 Mbit/s.

deployment:
  template: l2_qos.hot
#  accommodation: [pair, single_room, compute_nodes: 2]
  accommodation: [pair, double_room]
