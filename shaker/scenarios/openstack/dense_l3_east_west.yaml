title: OpenStack L3 East-West Dense

description:
  In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances on the same compute node.
  Instances are connected to different tenant networks connected to one
  router. The traffic goes from one network to the other (L3 east-west).

deployment:
  template: l3_east_west.hot
  accommodation: [pair, double_room, density: 8, compute_nodes: 1]

execution:
  progression: linear
