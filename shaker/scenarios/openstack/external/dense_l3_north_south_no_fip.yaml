title: OpenStack L3 North-South Dense to external target

description: >
  In this scenario Shaker launches instances on one compute node in a tenant
  network connected to external network. The traffic is sent to and from
  external host. The host name needs to be provided as command-line parameter,
  e.g. ``--matrix "{host: 172.10.1.2}"``.

deployment:
  template: l3_north_south_no_fip.hot
  accommodation: [double_room, density: 8, compute_nodes: 1]
