title: OpenStack L3 North-South Cross-AZ

description:
  In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances on different compute
  nodes. All available compute nodes are utilized. Instances are in different
  networks connected to different routers, master accesses slave by
  floating ip. The traffic goes from one network via external network to the
  other network. The master and slave instances are in different availability
  zones. The scenario is used to test throughput between `nova` and `vcenter`
  zones.
