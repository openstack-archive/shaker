title: L3 North-South Performance

description:
  This scenario launches 1 pair of VMs on different compute nodes. VMs are in
  the different networks connected via different routers, master accesses slave
  by floating ip. SLA on the bandwidth is verifyied.

deployment:
  template: l3_north_south.hot
  accommodation: [pair, single_room, compute_nodes: 2]

  tests:
