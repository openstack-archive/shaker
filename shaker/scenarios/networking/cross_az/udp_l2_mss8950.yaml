title: OpenStack L2 Cross-AZ UDP Jumbo

description:
  In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances in the same tenant
  network. Every instance is hosted on a separate compute node.
  The load is generated by UDP traffic and jumbo packets.
  The master and slave instances are in different availability zones.
  The scenario is used to test throughput between `nova` and `vcenter` zones.

deployment:
  template: l2.hot
  accommodation: [pair, single_room, zones: [nova, vcenter], cross_az]
