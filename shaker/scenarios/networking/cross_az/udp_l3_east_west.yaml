title: OpenStack L3 East-West Cross-AZ UDP

description:
  In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances, each instance on its own
  compute node. Instances are connected to one of 2 tenant networks, which
  plugged into single router. The traffic goes from one network to the other
  (L3 east-west). The load is generated by UDP traffic.
  The master and slave instances are in different availability zones.
  The scenario is used to test throughput between `nova` and `vcenter` zones.

deployment:
  template: l3_east_west.hot
  accommodation: [pair, single_room, zones: [nova, vcenter], cross_az]
