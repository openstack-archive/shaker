title: OpenStack L3 North-South Dense

description:
  This scenario launches pairs of VMs on one compute node. VMs are in
  the different networks connected via different routers, master accesses slave
  by floating ip

deployment:
  template: l3_north_south.hot
  accommodation: [pair, double_room, density: 8, compute_nodes: 1]

execution:
