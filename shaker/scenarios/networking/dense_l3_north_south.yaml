title: OpenStack L3 North-South Dense

description:
  In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances on the same compute node.
  Instances are connected to different tenant networks, each connected to own
  router. Instances in one of networks have floating IPs.
  The traffic goes from one network via external network to the other network.

deployment:
  template: l3_north_south.hot
  accommodation: [pair, double_room, density: 8, compute_nodes: 1]

execution:
  progression: linear
