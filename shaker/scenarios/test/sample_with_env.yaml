description:
  This test definition demonstrates the use of an environment file.

  In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances in the same tenant
  network. Every instance is hosted on a separate compute node, 1 compute node
  is utilized. The traffic goes within the tenant network (L2 domain)

deployment:
  template: l2_with_env.hot
  env_file: env/sample.env

  accommodation: [pair, compute_nodes: 1]
