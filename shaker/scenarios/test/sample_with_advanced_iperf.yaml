title: Sample TCP Test with Advanced Iperf Arguments

description:
  This test definition demonstrates the use of advanced arguments with iperf.

  In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances in the same tenant
  network. Every instance is hosted on a separate compute node, 1 compute node
  is utilized. The traffic goes within the tenant network (L2 domain) and uses
  arguments not directly mapped by the iperf executor.

deployment:
  template: l2_with_env.hot
  env_file: env/sample.env

  accommodation: [pair, compute_nodes: 1]

execution:
  tests:
  -

    buffer_size: 9000
    args: "--blockcount 1M --zerocopy --omit 1"
    sla:
    - "[type == 'agent'] >> (stats.bandwidth.avg > 5000)"
