title: Sample TCP Test with Support Stacks

description:
  This test definition demonstrates the use of support stacks

  In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances in the same tenant
  network. Each test VM is also connected to a previously launched
  support network. The support neworks are part of their own support
  heat stack. Every instance is hosted on a separate compute node,
  1 compute node is utilized. The traffic goes within the tenant network
  (L2 domain)

deployment:
  support_templates:
  -
    support_1:

      env_file: env/support_2.env

  template: templates/l2_with_support.hot
  env_file: env/l2_with_support.env
