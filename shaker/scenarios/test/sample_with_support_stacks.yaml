title: Sample TCP Test with Support Stacks

description:
  This test definition demonstrates the use of support stacks

  In this scenario Shaker launches pairs of instances in the same tenant
  network. Each test VM is also connected to a previously launched
  support network. The support neworks are part of their own support
  heat stack. Every instance is hosted on a separate compute node,
  1 compute node is utilized. The traffic goes within the tenant network
  (L2 domain)

deployment:
  support_templates:
  - name: support_1
    template: templates/support_network.hot
    env_file: env/support_1.env

  - name: support_2
    template: templates/support_network.hot
    env_file: env/support_2.env

  template: templates/l2_with_support.hot
  env_file: env/l2_with_support.env

  accommodation: [pair, compute_nodes: 1]
